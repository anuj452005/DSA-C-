/*Running the for loop till the square root of the number

A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by 1 and by itself. Examples 1 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 â€¦

Using a for loop for checking if the number is divisible by a number from 2 to its square root.

Running the for loop from 2 to the square root of the number.

And then checking if the number is divisible by the numbers from 2 to its square root.

Then, If the remainder is zero, that means it is divisible and hence not a prime number.

If the loop runs till square root and none of the numbers divided it completely. So it is the Prime number.*/
